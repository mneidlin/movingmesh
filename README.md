# Moving Mesh methodology from 3D RTE data as presented in Gruenwald et al. 2021

Read the How_to_MovingMesh_210719.pdf for detailed explanation of each step to perform simulations in ANSYS Fluent (tested with R2020 and R2021) software.

-ucd_stl_P3.zip includes output of 3D RTE after using TomTec ImageArena and the according STL files (output of ucd2stl.m)
-the folder udfpts includes the final output of ps_intNPts.py script (needs to be provided for the moving mesh in Fluent)
-pressure curves at inlet and outlet are provided as well
